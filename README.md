I strongly believe in open Science and basically this is the purpose of this repository: you can find all my previous analyses, with the R codes I scripted for. Once the ethical commitees authorized me, I also publish the datasets. With the codes and the data, you are perfectly able to check the appropriatness of my results, and you can repeat them. More importantly, I hope you'll perfect my codes and you'll share with me your experience!
